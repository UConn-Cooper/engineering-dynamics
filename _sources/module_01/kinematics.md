# Geometry of motion - kinematics

# Position

Classical physics describes the position of an object using three
independent coordinates e.g. 

$$
\mathbf{r}_{P/O} = x\hat{i} + y\hat{j} + z\hat{k}
$$ (position)

where $\mathbf{r}_{P/O}$ is the position of point $P$ _with respect to the point
of origin_ $O$, $x,~y,~z$ are magnitudes of distance along a
Cartesian coordinate system and $\hat{i},~\hat{j}$ and $\hat{k}$ are
unit vectors that describe three

# Velocity

The velocity of an object is the change in position, equation
{eq}`position`, per length of time.

$$
\mathbf{v}_{P/O} = \frac{d\mathbf{r}_{P/O}}{dt} = \dot{x}\hat{i} + \dot{y}\hat{j} +
\dot{z}\hat{k}
$$ (velocity)

```{note}
The notation $\dot{x}$ and $\ddot{x}$ is short-hand for writing out
$\frac{dx}{dt}$ and $\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$, respectively.
```

The definition of velocity in equation {eq}`velocity` depends upon the change in position of all
three independent coordinates, where
$\frac{d}{dt}(x\hat{i})=\dot{x}\hat{i}$. 


```{note}
Remember the chain rule: $\frac{d}{dt}(x\hat{i})=\dot{x}\hat{i} +
x\dot{\hat{i}}$, but $\dot{\hat{i}}=0$ because this unit vector is not
changing direction. You'll see other unit vectors later that _do
change_.
```

{numref}`postion-velocity`
## Example - GPS vs speedometer
You can find velocity based upon postion, but you can only find changes
in position with velocity. Consider tracking the motion of a car driving
down a road using GPS. You determine its motion and create the position,
$\mathbf{r} = x\hat{i} +y\hat{j}$, where


$x(t) = 4t +3$ and $y(t) = 3t - 1$

To get the velocity, calculate $\mathbf{v} = \dot{\mathbf{r}}$

$\mathbf{v} = 4\hat{i} +3 \hat{j}$

t = np.arange(0,5)
x = 4*t + 3
y = 3*t -1
plt.plot(x,y,'o')
plt.quiver(x,y,4,3)
plt.title('Position of car on road every 1 second'+
    '\nvelocity shown as arrow')
plt.xlabel('x-position (m)')
plt.ylabel('y-position (m)');
```




## Speed

The speed of an object is the
[magnitude](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/vectors.html) of the
velocity, 

$|\mathbf{v}_{P/O}| = \sqrt{\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{v}} =
\sqrt{\dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 + \dot{z}^2}$

# Acceleration

The acceleration of an object is the change in velocity per length of
time. 

$\mathbf{a}_{P/O} = \frac{d \mathbf{v}_{P/O} }{dt} = \ddot{x}\hat{i} +
\ddot{y}\hat{j} + \ddot{z}\hat{k}$

where $\ddot{x}=\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}$ and $\mathbf{a}_{P/O}$ is the
acceleration of point $P$ _with respect to the point of origin_ $O$. 

# Rotation and Orientation

The definitions of position, velocity, and acceleration all describe a
single point, but dynamic engineering systems are composed of rigid
bodies is needed to describe the position of an object.

```

_In the figure above, the center of the block is located at
$r_{P/O}=x\hat{i}+y\hat{j}$ in both the left and right images, but the
two locations are not the same. The orientation of the block is
important for determining the position of all the material points._

In general, a rigid body has a _pitch_, _yaw_, and _roll_ that describes
its rotational orientation, as seen in the animation below. We will
revisit 3D motion in Module_05

# Rotation in planar motion

Our initial focus is planar rotations e.g. yaw and roll are fixed. For a
body constrained to planar motion, you need 3 independent measurements
to describe its position e.g. $x$, $y$, and $\theta$
