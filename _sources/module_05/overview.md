# Module 5 - dynamics in your career

The best way to apply your knowledge in a subject is to try to teach
someone about it. In this module, you will create your own dynamics
example and we can share it here. 

This is your chance to teach me and your classmates something new. You
have applied the Newton-Euler, work-energy, and impulse-momentum
equations to a number of engineering systems and models, but now its
_your turn_ to choose an application and create a model. 

Some tips:
- __start simple__ its often easier to _add_ complexity rather than _remove_
  complexity if you're considering a 6-DOF system, try a 1-DOF part, then add
components incrementally
- __use what you have__ you have working models for four-bar linkages,
  pendulums, and a yoyo despinning mechanism can you take your system and model
a piece of it as a pendulum? is angular momentum conserved?
- __communicate__ let us know what you're working on simple sketches are great!
  don't get hung up on a final result until you have some sketches and
conversations
- __always draw a FBD__ this step is _so often_ skipped, but its really where
  the bulk of your engineering work is decided. The FBD is your main
contribution to any engineering project, everything else is a combination of
puzzle-solving and applied mathematics

## Objectives

Upon Completion of this module you will be able to 

1. Create an engineering project report
2. Explain your work to other people
3. Justify your assumptions in a model
4. Add your project to your engineering portfolio and resume
