Focus on:

1. __Equation 4.2__ Impulse-Momentum equation

2. __Example 4.1__ Impulsive spring

3. __Definition 4.2 and Equation 4.7__ Angular momentum for of Newton's second law

4. __Example 4.3__ Calculating the angular momentum of a moving point mass

5. __Example 4.7__ Tetherball

6. __Equations 5.6 and 5.16 and Table 5.1__ Work-energy equation and potential energy

6. __Example 9.17__ A flywheel

7. __Example 9.22__ Yo-yo de-spin 


__Choose three examples and discuss how kinematics and Newton's second law were
applied to create an equation of motion.__ Take a look at what the rest of the
class writes and add some discussion points on a colleague's interpretation.
