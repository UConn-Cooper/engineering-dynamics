# Module 3 - Constrained engineering systems

_4-bar linkage_

1. Engineering systems with many moving parts
    1. constrain the motion (0-DOF)
    2. to maintain motion need constraint forces
    3. constraints doing work vs constraint force
2. Mechanical advantage
    1. gear ratios
    2. levers
    3. linkages
3. Relative motion
    1. fixing coordinate systems to moving parts
    2. absolute and relative motion
    3. constraint forces and work done
