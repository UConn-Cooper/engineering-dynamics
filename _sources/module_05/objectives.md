# Module 05 - Spinning top design

Welcome to the final Module in Applied Mechanics II. We are applying Newton's
second law to the motion of rigid bodies. Our goal is to predict the motion of a
spinning top and create our own design meant for 3D printing. 

## Objectives

Upon Completion of this module you will be able to 

1. Predict the motion of rigid bodies using Newton's second law

2. Calculate moments and products of inertia using the parallel axis theorem

3. Calculate the radius of gyration

4. Design a spinning top

5. Predict the motion of a spinning top using Newton's second law
 
## Activities

This module includes the following activities:

* Complete the required reading and post discussions on [Piazza]()
* Watch the lecture videos and answer the questions
* Complete one homework assignment from the readings
* Finish a tutorial on Adams and complete the Google form
* Take a 20-min quiz
* Submit your spinning top design
* Turn in a 4-5 page report that compares the Adams spinning top motion to the analytical prediction of motion
