# Module 03 - Yoyo de-spinning mechanism

Welcome to the third Module in Applied Mechanics II. In modules 01 and 02, we
used Newton's second law to create equations of motion based upon external
forces and moments. In this module, you will learn how to quantify the effect of
impulse and work on the motion of objects. Our goal is to design a rocket
stabilization method that uses conservation of angular momentum to slow the
rotation of a rocket during take-off. 

## Objectives

Upon Completion of this module you will be able to 

1. Define impulse and momentum in a dynamic system

2. Define work and energy in a dynamic system

3. Calculate linear momentum, angular momentum of moving bodies

4. Calculate the kinetic energy of moving bodies

5. Use kinematics, conservation of energy, and conservation of momentum to solve
for the motion of Yoyo de-spinning mechanism
 
## Activities

This module includes the following activities:

* Complete the required reading and post discussions on [Piazza]()
* Watch the lecture videos and answer the questions
* Complete one homework assignment from the readings
* Finish a tutorial on Adams and complete the Google form
* Take a 20-min quiz
* Submit your spinning top design
* Turn in a 4-5 page report that compares the Adams spinning top motion to the analytical prediction of motion
