You should report your model set up and main findings when modeling the spinning
top. 

# Participate in the Champion Top-Spinning Contest 

Create  a video of your own spinning top design in Adams simulation. Post the
video on Youtube (or movie in Google Drive with a shared link):

Create a new top design and run a simulation that meets the following criteria:
1. It has a density of 1250 kg/m3
2. Its total mass is <3 g
3. Its nutation (the bouncing) is <5deg amplitude at 45 rot/s spinning speed
You post your video on Youtube and submit the link to your movie
