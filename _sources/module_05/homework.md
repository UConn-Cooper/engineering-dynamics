__1.__ Solve for the problem shown in [Rigid Body Impact](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nCQ7GvYNloXdjRs34JcepbIQEMBOAHUv/view?usp=sharing):
A ball is given an initial horizontal velocity, 6 m/s, at height, h=2m. After it
impacts the ground it begins to spin. The mass is 0.5 kg and the radius is 0.05 m. Assume coefficient of restitution is e=1. 

What is the velocity after impact?

What is the angular velocity after impact?
