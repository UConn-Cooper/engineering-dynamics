# Module 4 - Momentum and Energy

_yoyo despin_

This module uses energy and momentum methods directly.

1. Energy and Momentum are different forms of Newton's
   second law
   1. Impulse-momentum is Fdt=dp
   2. Work-energy is Fdx=dT
   3. momentum is a vector
   4. energy is a scalar
2. Describes states of system
  1. Impulse happens over short time in impact
  2. energy in conservative system ia conserved
  3. combining methods
