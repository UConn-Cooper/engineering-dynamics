## Materials 
* [Kasdin and Paley's _Engineering Dynamics_ ch. 8](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvcm4ggj.11) 

Focus on:

1. __Equations 8.5, 8.13, 8.21, and definition 8.1__: The transport equation

2. __Example 8.1__ Kinematics of a compound pendulum

3. __Example 8.2__ The velocity of a rolling wheel

4. __Example 8.3__ The gear ratio

5. __Example 8.4__ A two-bar linakage

6. __Example 8.7__ A ~~three-~~four-bar linkage

7. __Tutorial 8.1__ The Watt linkage 

__Choose three examples and discuss how kinematics (specifically the transport
equation) were applied to describe the geometry of motion.__ Take a look at
what the rest of the class writes and add some discussion points on a
colleague's interpretation.
