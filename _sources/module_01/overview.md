# Module 1 - Dynamic equations and definitions

_ball rolling on plane_

In this course, we are focused on kinematic _geometry of motion_ and kinetic
_forces, energy, and impacts_ equations. This module covers the basic equations
and definitions for describing dynamic motion.

# Outline

1. Kinematics
	1. define position
	2. velocity 
	3. acceleration
	4. degrees of freedom and coordinates
2. Kinetics
	1. Newton-Euler equations
	2. Impulse-momentum
	3. Work-energy
	4. equations of motion = second order diff eq
3. Solving dynamic problem
	1. Newton-Euler equations define eom
	2. Use ODE solution for x(t)
