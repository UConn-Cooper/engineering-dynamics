Focus on:

1. __Example 3.1__ Solving the pendulum using Cartesian Coordinates

3. __Examples 3.4, 3.9, 3.11__ The simple pendulum using different coordinates

1. __Example 4.4__ Solving the pendulum using angular momentum

2. __Section 3.2.4__ Coordinate systems

4. __Table 3.1__ Properties of the vector derivative

5. __Example 3.6__ The vector derivative on an inlined plane

6. __Example 3.14__ Pendulum in an accelerating box

7. __Tutorial 3.3__ Particle sliding on a hemisphere


__Choose three examples and discuss how kinematics and Newton's second law were
applied to create an equation of motion.__ Take a look at what the rest of the
class writes and add some discussion points on a colleague's interpretation.
