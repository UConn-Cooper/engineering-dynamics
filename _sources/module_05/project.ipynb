    "This is your chance to build something important to you and/or your career. If you're interested in cars you can create a drivetrain model. If you want to get into biomechanics you can model an orthopedic joint or build a 2D model of someone walking. If you love toys (_I know Prof. Cooper does!_) you can model a yoyo spinning on a cord or a spinning top or measure the coefficient of restitution of a bouncy ball on concrete. \n",
