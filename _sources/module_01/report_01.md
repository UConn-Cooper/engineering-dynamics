__C:__ all work from video was done correctly, FBD/KD is correct, a few graphs help
the explanation in the results/discussion, and conclusion states main results
and mentions sources of error

__B:__ work from the video is validated with analytical model (correctly), graphs
compare analytical and Adams solutions in results/discussion, and conclusion
states main results and mentions sources of error

__A:__ same as B/C + further analysis using drag on stone, discussion of
conservation of energy and work done
