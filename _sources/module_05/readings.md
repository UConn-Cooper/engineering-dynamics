Focus on:

1. __Equations 9.1, 9.6__

2. __Example 9.9 & 9.19__ Rolling on an incline

3. __Example 9.13 & 9.15__ The Compound Pendulum

3. __Example 9.17__ A flywheel

4. __Equation 11.8__ Euler's second law in 3D

4. __Example 11.5__ A spinning top

4. __Example 11.9__ A spinning symmetric body

4. __Example 11.13__ Exact Solution of a Gyroscope

__Choose three examples and discuss how kinematics and Newton's second law were
applied to create an equation of motion.__ Take a look at what the rest of the
class writes and add some discussion points on a colleague's interpretation.
